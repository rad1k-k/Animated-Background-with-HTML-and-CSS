# Animated-Background-with-HTML-and-CSS-STARS

I am creating an animation where stars will appear from the bottom, grow bigger in size, and disappear after being on top. I have created the stars using CSS Pseudo-Elements.<br> <br>
After that, I have positioned the star elements in the different places of the project. <br> <br>
With CSS3, we can animate multiple things at once and control how long a specific animation performs. I have used different animation-delay values for each li element. I ended up using the CSS keyframes animation property to get the required result.
